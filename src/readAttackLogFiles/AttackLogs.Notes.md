# What I know

- The file fills as the battle plays out
- The given name of the mech is what shows up. Name one 'Bob' in the mechbay and that's how it is listed
- Streak weapons don't show when they miss, this only shows attacks made that are visible.
- Ground as a target, is a miss.
- AOE effects have a to hit roll of 0
- Round to at least 1

# What I don't know

- The adjusted roll to hit and how it works. Adjusted matches if it's a hit or miss, but I already know if it hit or not by the target
- Damage is floating point for some things. No idea how it rounds if at all.
