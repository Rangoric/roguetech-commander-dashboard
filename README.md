# RogueTech Commander Dashboard

Using the logs that RogueTech spits out, this handy dandy tool will make some pretty charts and graphs and give you information about how your mechs are performing.

## Plans

I want to have this open while playing so I can see how various weapons / mechs are performing. There are many variables to take into account for really knowing how a mech is performing. But, as a baseline, it would be nice to know that during the entire battle, what weapons pulled their weight and which ones seem to be cool but don't really do much. It's hard to track all those tiny numbers.
